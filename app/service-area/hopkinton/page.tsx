            question: "Can you put hot pans on granite countertops?",
            answer:
                "Yes, granite is naturally heat-resistant and can handle brief contact with hot pans without damage. However, we still recommend using trivets or hot pads as a best practice—not because granite will immediately crack, but because extreme, prolonged direct heat (like a 500-degree pan sitting in one spot for minutes) could potentially cause thermal shock in rare cases. Think of it this way: granite can handle it, but why risk it when a $5 trivet gives you complete peace of mind? The real advantage is that if you occasionally forget and set down a hot pot, your granite won't show a burn mark like laminate would.",
        },
        {
            question: "How often do granite countertops need to be sealed?",
            answer:
                "Most granite countertops need sealing every 12-24 months, though this varies by stone type—some dense granites need it annually, while more porous varieties might need it twice a year. Here's the good news: sealing takes about 15 minutes and costs around $20 for a DIY bottle of sealer. That's the entire 'maintenance' people worry about. We show you how to do it during installation, and we're always available if you have questions. Many of our Hopkinton clients tell us, 'I thought maintenance would be a hassle, but it's literally easier than cleaning my oven.' We also test your granite during installation and let you know exactly how often your specific stone will need sealing."
        },
        {
            question: "Which is more expensive, granite or quartz countertops?",
            answer:
                "It depends on the specific materials you're comparing, but generally, mid-range granite and mid-range quartz cost roughly the same. Here's the real question: which offers better value for your situation? Granite requires periodic sealing but offers unique natural patterns—no two slabs are identical. Quartz requires zero maintenance but has more uniform patterns. For busy Hopkinton families who want set-it-and-forget-it performance, quartz often delivers better long-term value despite similar upfront costs. For Hopkinton homeowners who love natural stone's organic beauty and don't mind 15 minutes of sealing once a year, granite is worth every penny. We'll never push you toward the more expensive option—we'll push you toward the right option for your lifestyle and budget.",
        },
        {
            question: "Does quartz stain easily?",
            answer:
                "High-quality quartz (which is all we install) is highly stain-resistant, not stain-proof—there's a difference. Here's what that means in real life: Coffee, wine, tomato sauce, oil—normal kitchen spills wipe right up, even if they sit for a few hours. Where quartz can potentially stain is from things like permanent markers, hair dye, or strong chemical solvents left on the surface for extended periods. A Hopkinton client once asked us, 'What if my kids use markers on it?' We told her, 'Wipe it up within a day or two and you're fine. Let Sharpie sit for a week and you might have an issue.' After three years with three kids, she reports zero stains. The key? Quartz is incredibly forgiving for normal daily use, which is why busy families love it.",
