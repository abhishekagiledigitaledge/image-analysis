          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            “We,” “Us,” “Our,” or “Stone Concepts” refers to Stone Concepts, Inc., its affiliates, employees, and agents.
            “Services” include consultation, measurement, fabrication, installation, delivery, and any associated work we perform.
            “Contract” means any written or electronic agreement between Stone Concepts and the Client, including proposals, quotes, or work orders, incorporating these Terms.
            If any inconsistency exists between these Terms and a signed contract, the signed contract prevails.

          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-2">
            <strong>Quotations & Estimates:</strong> All quotations are valid for 30 days unless otherwise stated. Pricing may change if project specifications, materials, or measurements differ after templating.

            <strong>Deposit & Payment Terms:</strong> A non-refundable deposit of 30–50% (as stated in the quote) is required before work commences. The remaining balance is due before or at installation. Payment must be made by cash, check, or approved electronic transfer.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-2">
            <strong>Changes & Cancellations:</strong> Requests for changes must be made in writing prior to fabrication. Once fabrication begins, cancellations are subject to material and labor costs incurred. Custom materials cannot be returned.

            <strong>Material Variations:</strong> Natural stone and quartz surfaces may vary in color, veining, and texture. These variations are inherent characteristics, not defects.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-2">
            <strong>Inspection & Approval:</strong> Clients are encouraged to view and approve slabs in person before cutting. Once cutting begins, changes cannot be made.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-2">
            <strong>Site Conditions:</strong> Cabinets, appliances, and fixtures must be level and properly installed before templating. Additional trips or delays caused by incomplete site readiness may incur additional charges.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-2">
            <strong>Warranty & Limitations:</strong> Stone Concepts warrants its fabrication and installation workmanship for one (1) year from the installation date under normal residential use. This warranty excludes damage caused by misuse, abuse, chemical exposure, impact, or structural movement. Natural characteristics such as pits, fissures, and color variations are not covered. Proof of purchase and payment in full are required for warranty service.

            Ownership of all materials remains with Stone Concepts until full payment is received. Risk of loss passes to the client upon delivery. Clients must inspect all materials within 48 hours of delivery and notify Stone Concepts of any visible damage. Delays due to weather, supply chain, or causes beyond our control shall not constitute breach of contract.
